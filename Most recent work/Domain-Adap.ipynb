This problem indicates we have concern in what we have observed that will be used to predict what we think represents the population. Therefore, the former one relects our sample setting but the latter focuses on the research of interest in population. \n",
    "\n",
    "If we have observed a joint distribution $P(x_0,y_0) \\in \\mathcal{X \\times Y}=p(y_0|x_0)p(x_0)$, we are trying to use the data under observed estimated distribution to predict the new distribution. Therefore, the distribution or covaraites have shifted. Given appropriate assumption that the conditional distribution $p(y_0|x)$ remains the same in both scenario, it is provably useful to use the ratio of two unconditional distributions $p(x_0)$ and $q(x)$. A correction weight $w=\\frac{q(x_0)}{p(x_0)}$ is calculated and added to the scheduled estimator to correct this distribution shift. We will provide a short review of proof."
