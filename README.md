# Causal Learning and Counterfactuals

This documentation serves as a run-down for causal machine learning that covers some most classic methods and the most recent advancement. This is a document under active development and some materials will be a reflection or reference to Ruocheng Guo, a principal researcher at ByteDance,UK. 

Because my central interest is counterfactual learning and bandit-based recommendation system, this document might not be a thorough reflection of anything you have seen in the causal world. Advice and commentes are welcome. Thank you for your interest in causal inference.

Topics will include:

-**Basic of Counterfactual Learning**:


-**Off-line Reinforcement Learning**:

Off-line reinforcement learning has been widely used in recommendation systems and contextual bandit for off-policy evaluation. I will follow papers that mark the most recent advancement of this field and do some sample-based implementation; I will also try my best to make some direct tie-ins and connect each method in terms of my personal understanding.
-**Causal Dicovery and Graphic Models**:

this topic does not quite match the conventional framework **Potential Outcome** mainly used in observational study by Rubin
