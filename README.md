# Knowledge Map: Essential3CRL

>Essential3CRL is short for Essential Counterfactual/Causal/Core Reinforcement Learning. This documentation serves as a run-down for causal machine learning that covers some most classic methods and the most recent advancement of **Off-line Reinforcement Learning, Contextual Bandit Feedback, Domain Adaptation Under Distribution Shift**. This is a document under active development and some materials will be a reflection or reference to [Ruocheng Guo](https://github.com/rguo12/
awesome-causality-algorithms), a principal researcher at ByteDance,UK. 

<hr>

We hope these materials can speed up your study and "reinforce" your understanding of causality, counterfactuals, and demain adaptation. Because my central interest is counterfactual learning and bandit-based recommendation system, this document might not be a thorough reflection of anything you have seen in the causal world. Advice and commentes are welcome. Thank you for your interest in causal inference.

Topics will include:

## Basic of Counterfactual Learning:

## Off-line Reinforcement Learning:

Off-line reinforcement learning has been widely used in recommendation systems and contextual bandit for off-policy evaluation. I will follow papers that mark the most recent advancement of this field and do some sample-based implementation; I will also try my best to make some direct tie-ins and connect each method in terms of my personal understanding.

## Causal Dicovery and Graphic Discovery:

this topic does not quite match the conventional framework **Potential Outcome** mainly used in observational study by Rubin. Therefore, please visit another repository I build to start your journey of DAGs and Graphical Causality Discovery.
