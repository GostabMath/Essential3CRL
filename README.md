# On Improving ContextualBandit Performance With Sensitivity Value Design
## *Description*:

-This work is to follow the most recent development of **contextual bandit** and expand the design perspective of **counterfactual system** and seek a possible workaround such as
"How to formulate our contextual bandit problem such that researchers can get a more stable, bigger expected reward that is less sensitive to unobserved features.
